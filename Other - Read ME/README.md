Please note, about the commentaries, that the header and the footer commentaries are just explained through the HomePage.html page.

Moreover, the commentaries for the database's connection are only explained in the addItemS.php file.

We are using PHPmyadmin to store our data in a database

The .DS_STORE file is only here to adapt the proper running of the code on MAC OS; indeed, we used GIT to share our files and have constantly the files to work on

We started to work on the project the 4th March, and ended it the 31th March

Our sources are mentionned into the sources.txt file
