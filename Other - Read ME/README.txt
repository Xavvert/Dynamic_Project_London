# Dynamic_Project_London

Made and Designed by CHARVET Anthelme & DANDIGNA Xavier - Spring 2020/2021 INSEEC U London Y3 ECE PARIS

Please note, about the commentaries, that the header and the footer commentaries are just explained through the HomePage.html page.

Moreover, the commentaries for the database's connection are only explained in the addItemS.php file.

We are using PHPmyadmin to store our data in a database

The .DS_STORE file is only here to adapt the proper running of the code on MAC OS; indeed, we used GIT to share our files and have constantly the files to work on

Our sources are mentionned into the sources.txt file

To run the project, please import the database with the images to phpmyadmin (you might change some settings in php my admin to allow the insertion of more than 15MB at once)
Then launch wampserver and the project with HomePage.html and enjoy :)
